# DBUS-BLE-Connection
Hello, this is my first real project using CPP

It's a kind of BLE serial communication framework that allows to communicate a linux computer with BLE devices such as an ESP32

The program used to create the framework is in ```embeded``` 

The dir to build the .so library is in ```framework```

You can find a sample program using the framework in ```test```

Here you can find the matching sample program for ESP32 using plateformio in vscode => https://github.com/ZZ0R0/ESP32_BLE_Connection
